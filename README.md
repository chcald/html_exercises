## Exercise 1
Update the website HTML, without using JavaScript or CSS, to make
use of semantic elements so that:

* The classless outer div element is replaced with a more
  appropriate element.
* The divs with the image and caption classes are replaced with self-
  contained content elements.
* The divs with the lorem-ipsum and description classes are replaced
  with elements, so that by default only the contents of the description
  element are shown. When the contents of the description element are 
  clicked, the rest of the lorem-insum element is toggled.


## Exercise 2
Using CSS only (without adding additional HTML attributes), style articles so that they occupy the whole browser window and have the fallowing properties.
